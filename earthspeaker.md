# Earthspeaker Domain

Submitting a first draft of a new domain I've created.

**Earthspeaker Domain**

Granted Power: Tremorsense 30 ft

Spells:

 1. Earthen Grasp: Arm made of earth and soil grapples foes.
 2. Augury: Learns whether an action will be good or bad.
 3. Divination: Provides useful advice for specific, proposed action.
 4. Commune: Deity answers one yes-or-no question/level. (May only be used to commune with the Pits)
 5. Stone Tell: Talk to natural or worked stone.
 6. Move Earth: Digs trenches and builds hills.
 7. Earthquake: Intense tremor shakes 80-ft radius.
 8. Iron Body: Your body becomes living iron.
 9. Transmute Rock to Lava: Transforms one 10-ft. cube with subsequent fire damage and effects.

This is an Earthen-specific domain, reserved for those who most revere their creator, the Protolith Pits. As most Earthen do not meet the requirements to become Clerics, there are only a limited number of ways to attain this template. The most common method is by taking the [Arcane Disciple](http://dndtools.eu/feats/complete-divine--56/arcane-disciple--92/) feat. Another way is by taking it as a Wizard domain, as per the variant class ruling in Unearthed Arcana.

On a similar note, the [Rainbow Servant](http://dndtools.eu/classes/rainbow-servant/) prestige class has been renamed as Earthspeaker. The class has been altered in the following ways:

At 1st level, the Earthspeaker gains the ability to cast *detect mother* and *detect father* at will. These are spell-like abilities that specifically detect the presence of the Mother's or Father's power, respectively - this includes Spirits, Spiritborn, items created through divine magic, or specific materials with divine origin (eg Mithral and Living Steel, which are materials created from ore that has been influenced by the power of the Father or the Mother, respectively). This replaces the class's standard *detect evil* ability.

The Earthspeaker also gains the granted power and spell access of the Earthspeaker domain, listed above. This replaces the standard Good domain. For an explanation of how nonclerics receive domain spells, see the Extra Domains section on page 20 of the Complete Divine book.

At 4th level, the Earthspeaker gains the granted power and spell access of the Liberation domain (Spell Compendium p 276). This replaces the standard Air domain.

The Earthspeaker also gains the Earth Glide ability, as per an earth elemental of its size. This ability has a daily duration of 1 minute per Earthspeaker level, divided up however the Earthspeaker. It takes a standard action to activate or eliminate this feature. This replaces the standard Grow Wings feature.

At 7th level, the Earthspeaker gains the granted power and spell access of the Law domain. This is the standard class feature.

The Earthspeaker does not gain the ability to cast *detect chaos* at will, which is the standard class feature.

I am still thinking of suitable replacements for the 10th level class features. Full Cleric spell access no longer makes sense. Tim suggested granting access to all arcane spells instead. I considered granting access to spells with the Earth descriptor, and/or perhaps any spell with the word "earth" in its name. I'm not completely satisfied with either as a replacement, however.

As for a replacement for at will *detect thoughts*, I'm thinking something along the lines of [*stone shape*](http://dndtools.eu/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/stone-shape--2881/) . Possibly nerfed slightly - maybe make it scale off of Earthspeaker level, not character level (so, up to 20 cubic feet manipulated at a time). Thoughts?
